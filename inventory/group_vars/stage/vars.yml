#                                   You requested an embargoed dissertation or thesis, '{2}' ({1}), from our repository, JScholarship. Because of that embargo, we cannot supply the files you request. We also don't have a way to contact the author for permission.
#                                   You can wait until the embargo deadline has passed or look for the author and request the files from them.
#                                   Thank you,
#                                   ETD Services"
